# 🧠 Deep Learning Practice Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on deep learning practice projects! This repository is part of my ongoing learning journey in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning.

Each project here is designed to explore core concepts, experiment with different architectures, and build a strong foundation in model development, training, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Projects Included

### 1. MNIST Digit Classification
A basic convolutional neural network (CNN) built to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.  
> **Highlights**: Data preprocessing, CNN architecture, training visualization, and evaluation metrics.
