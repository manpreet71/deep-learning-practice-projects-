# 🧮 MNIST Digit Classification

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset. It serves as a foundational exercise to understand deep learning concepts such as image preprocessing, CNN architecture, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📚 Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images  
Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel of handwritten digits (0 to 9).

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is a simple CNN architecture built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, consisting of:

- Convolutional Layers
- MaxPooling Layers
- Flatten Layer
- Fully Connected (Dense) Layers
- Softmax Output for 10-class classification
